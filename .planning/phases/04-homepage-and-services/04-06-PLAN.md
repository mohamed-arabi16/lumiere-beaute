<objective>
Human visual verification of all Phase 4 success criteria across the homepage and services page.

Purpose: Plans 02–05 built and assembled everything autonomously. This checkpoint verifies the real browser experience before Phase 5. Six success criteria from the roadmap must be confirmed by the developer (Mohamed) interacting with the running app.

Output: Human confirmation that all 6 Phase 4 roadmap success criteria pass.

  <name>Task 1: Run build verification and start dev server</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Run the following commands from /Users/mohamedkhair/Coding/lumiere-beaute:

1. `npm run build` — must exit with code 0 and print a bundle size. If it fails, fix TypeScript/import errors before proceeding.
2. `npm run dev` — start the development server (note the localhost URL, typically http://localhost:5173)

Report:
- Build success/failure and bundle size
- Dev server URL
- Any TypeScript errors found and auto-fixed
  </action>
  <verify>npm run build exits with code 0; dev server starts on localhost</verify>
  <done>Production build succeeds with zero errors; development server is running and accessible</done>

  <what-built>
Complete Phase 4 implementation:
- Homepage: HeroSection (parallax gradient + TypewriterText + CTAs), StatsSection (count-up animation), ServicesTeaserSection (3 cards → /services), AcademyTeaserSection (2 cards → /academy), TestimonialsSection (3 client quotes)
- ServicesPage: 5 category tabs with sliding underline indicator, 20 treatment cards filtered per tab with AnimatePresence entry/exit animations
- All text from i18next locale JSON (TR/EN/AR) — zero hardcoded strings
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Open http://localhost:5173 in Chrome with DevTools available.

**SC1 — Hero parallax + typewriter (HOME-01):**
1. Visit http://localhost:5173 (home)
2. Confirm: headline types itself character by character
3. Scroll slowly down — confirm: the hero background gradient shifts subtly (parallax effect visible)
4. Confirm: two CTA buttons visible below headline

**SC2 — Animated stats counter (HOME-02):**
5. Scroll past the hero to the stats section
6. Confirm: numbers count up from 0 to their target values (500+, 8, 20+)
7. Scroll back up and back down — confirm: counters do NOT re-animate (once: true)

**SC3 — Services teaser navigation (HOME-03):**
8. Click any services teaser card or the "View All Treatments" button
9. Confirm: navigates to /services with the cinematic page transition animation

**SC4 — Academy teaser navigation (HOME-04):**
10. Go back to homepage; scroll to academy teaser section
11. Click any academy teaser card or the "Explore Courses" button
12. Confirm: navigates to /academy with page transition animation

**SC5 — Testimonials (HOME-05):**
13. Go back to homepage; scroll to testimonials section
14. Confirm: at least 3 client quotes visible, each with author name and role

**SC6 — Services filter (SRVC-01 + SRVC-02):**
15. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/services
16. Confirm: 5 category tabs visible (Facial, Body, Hair, Nail, Eye or translated equivalents)
17. Click each tab: confirm treatment cards change, underline indicator slides to active tab
18. Confirm: each card shows treatment name, description, duration, and price (SRVC-02)

**RTL verification:**
19. Click ع in the navbar to switch to Arabic
20. Visit homepage — confirm Arabic text, RTL layout (navbar items right-aligned)
21. Visit services — confirm Arabic category tab labels, Arabic treatment names, RTL card layout

**Reduced motion (optional — if system setting available):**
22. Enable "Reduce motion" in macOS System Preferences → Accessibility
23. Reload and confirm hero parallax is static, stats show final values immediately

Report: "approved" if all 6 criteria pass, or describe specifically which criterion failed and what you observed.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all 6 Phase 4 success criteria pass, or describe any failures</resume-signal>
</task>

All 6 Phase 4 roadmap success criteria confirmed by human:

2. Stats count up from 0 on scroll into view; do not re-animate on scroll-back
3. Services teaser CTA navigates to /services with page transition
4. Academy teaser CTA navigates to /academy with page transition
5. 3+ testimonials display with quote, author, role
6. Services page: 5 category tabs filter 20 treatments; each card shows name/description/duration/price
