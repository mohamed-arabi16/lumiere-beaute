<objective>
Human verification of all four Phase 7 success criteria — confirming locale file split works, Arabic copy is corrected, scroll animations are smooth, and the custom cursor behaves correctly across desktop and touch.

Purpose: Phase 7 delivers observable UX changes that require human eye verification — scroll animations, cursor behavior, and Arabic copy quality cannot be fully validated by TypeScript or automated checks alone.

Output: Phase 7 marked COMPLETE with all four POL requirements verified.

  <name>Phase 7 Human Verification: POL-01 through POL-04</name>
  <action>
    Run `npm run dev` and open http://localhost:5173. Walk through the four verification checks below:

    **POL-01 — Locale file split:**
    Run `ls src/i18n/locales/ar/ src/i18n/locales/en/ src/i18n/locales/tr/` — each shows only one file (ar.json, en.json, tr.json); no common.json visible anywhere. Language switching in the browser still loads Turkish/English/Arabic content correctly.

    **POL-02 — Arabic copy:**
    Switch language to Arabic (عربي). Navigate to the homepage subtitle and Academy section. Confirm `دورات` is used (not `كورسات`). Read through Arabic text for natural phrasing — no obvious machine-translation artifacts, no em dash in Arabic prose.

    **POL-03 — Scroll animations:**
    In English or Turkish, scroll slowly through the homepage. Observe: (a) the "Our Services" heading fades in and rises as the section enters the viewport — effect reverses slightly when scrolling back up (continuous linkage, not one-shot); (b) the dark Testimonials section background subtly scales from slightly larger to natural size as it enters viewport center. Both are distinct from the existing hero parallax.

    **POL-04 — Custom cursor:**
    On desktop (not DevTools touch emulation): move the mouse — a small teal dot follows with spring lag. Hover over any button or nav link — dot expands to 36px ring with lighter celadon border. Move off — ring shrinks back. Open DevTools Device Toolbar (touch emulation) — native cursor reappears, custom dot gone.

    Type "approved" if all 4 pass. Or describe any issues and Claude will diagnose and fix.
  </action>
  <verify>
    All 4 POL criteria confirmed by human in browser:
    - POL-01: ar.json / en.json / tr.json exist; common.json absent; language switching works
    - POL-02: Arabic shows دورات, no كورسات; prose reads naturally
    - POL-03: Two new scroll-driven animations on homepage (Services heading Y+opacity, Testimonials background scale)
    - POL-04: Custom cursor tracks with spring; hover ring on interactive elements; touch emulation restores native cursor
    Also: `npx tsc --noEmit` exits 0 (no TypeScript errors)
  </verify>
  <done>Human types "approved" — all four Phase 7 success criteria satisfied in browser.</done>
</task>

Human confirms all four POL success criteria in browser as described above.

<success_criteria>
- POL-01: ar.json, en.json, tr.json confirmed present; common.json confirmed absent; language switching works
- POL-02: Arabic mode shows دورات, no كورسات; copy reads naturally
- POL-03: Two scroll-driven animations visible on homepage scrolling (Services heading + Testimonials background)
- POL-04: Custom cursor tracks on desktop; hover ring on interactive elements; touch emulation shows native cursor
- Phase 7 COMPLETE — all four POL requirements satisfied
</success_criteria>

<output>
After human approval, create `.planning/phases/07-polish-and-ux/07-05-SUMMARY.md` following the summary template.
Update `.planning/STATE.md` to reflect Phase 7 COMPLETE.
Update `.planning/ROADMAP.md` Phase 7 status to complete with today's date.
